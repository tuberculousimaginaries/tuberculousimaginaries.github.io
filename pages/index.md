Tuberculous Imaginaries responds to the representation of medicine's past through an immersive, non-linear examination of tuberculosis. Drawing on the graphic, photographic, and imagined visual culture surrounding the disease, this project critically engages with the narratives of health promoted by medical professionals during the period of inquiry (~1880-1926).
